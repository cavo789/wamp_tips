## Install another version of PHP

First, you need to know if you've a `Thread Safety` version of not.

1. Open your local website [http://localhost:8080?phpinfo=1](http://localhost:8080?phpinfo=1) and search for `Thread Safety`, check if the value is `enabled` or not.
2. Go to [https://windows.php.net/download](https://windows.php.net/download) and download your version, take a `Thread Safe 64x` version if `Thread Safety` was enabled. **Note: you can get a very precise version, let's say  `7.4.1` in the [archive](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/archives/) section. Take a `xxx_-Win32-vc15-x64.zip` file fpr a 64bits Thread Safe binary.**
3. Unzip the file in your `c:\wamp64\bin\php` folder and create a folder for the PHP version (f.i. `c:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.4.4` *we'll use that name for the next steps*).
4. Copy the `wampserver.conf` file from a previous folder; f.i. copy  `c:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.4.0\wampserver.conf` to `c:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.4.4\wampserver.conf`.
5. Duplicate the `c:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.4.4\php.ini-development` file and create `c:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.4.4\php.ini`
6. Edit `c:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.4.4\php.ini` and update values for the following variables; make sure the value is a valid path on your system (make sure to use the Unix directory separator `/`)
   1. `error_log` = "C:/wamp64/logs/php_error.log"
   2. `extension_dir` = "C:/wamp64/bin/php/php7.4.4/ext/"
   3. `upload_tmp_dir` = "C:/wamp64/tmp"
   4. `session.save_path` = "C:/wamp64/tmp"
   5. `soap.wsdl_cache_dir` = "C:/wamp64/tmp"
7. Duplicate the `c:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.4.4\php.ini` file and create `c:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.4.4\phpForApache.ini`

Note: `php.ini` is used by DOS and `phpForApache.ini` is used by Apache i.e. when running a web page.

Note: also make sure to edit your Windows Environment Variables here and there to replace any links to the old PHP version to use the newer one (so replace f.i. any links to PHP 7.3.x to the installed version of PHP).

## Create a new host

Just go to the `C:\wamp64\alias` folder, duplicate an existing `.conf` file and edit the file.

Change the alias name and the path (make sure to use the Unix syntax).

Restart the Wamp server.

Attention: make sure to configure MySQL to use port `3306`. Right-click on the Wamp icon in the tray-panel, select `Tools` and update the port if needed.
